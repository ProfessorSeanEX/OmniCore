# 🛠️ **Watchtower Debugger Phase 0 — Finalization Log**

## 🌀 **Core Philosophy**

* The Watchtower is designed to **interpret alignment**, not just detect failure.
* Output must be **human-readable**, **developer-usable**, and **spiritually clear**.
* Logs represent **relational moments**, not just events.
* The implementation is in **Rust**, targeting stability, readability, and Kingdom-grounded diagnostics.

---

## 📁 **Verified Folder + File Structure**

### 🔹 `code/`

* `lib.rs` — Core library module. Successfully wires in Watchtower, schemas, and utils.

### 🔹 `code/watchtower/`

* `mod.rs` — Root orchestrator module.
* `watchtower.rs` — Entrypoint logic to the Watchtower loop (present but limited).
* `monitoring/alignment.rs` — Alignment score engine, mapped to `Base10`.
* `logs/log_entry.rs` — Log construction logic for dynamic `LogEntry` creation.

### 🔹 `code/util/`

* `mod.rs` — Routes utilities cleanly.
* `severity.rs` — Defines multiple severity scales. **Confirmed: Base10, Base5, Base20, Base25, Base50.**
* `log_type_scoring_profile.rs` — Maps `LogType` to score ranges and severity based on alignment.

### 🔹 `code/schemas/`

* `base_log_entry.rs` — Establishes the `BaseLogEntry` schema.
* `log_type.rs` — Enum of all `LogType` variants with matching default severity types.
* `specialized_log_entry.rs` — Scaffolding for type-based log extensions (present, partially filled).
* `alignment.rs` — Alignment classification schema.
* `severity.rs` — Central enum mapping for severity levels.
* `log_writer.rs` — Present, but not yet wired for persistent file I/O.
* `log_router.rs` — Exists, but incomplete — dispatch logic not yet active.

## 🧱 **Infrastructure Confirmation**

### 🔸 `.env` Flow (✅ Confirmed)

* Present and used across `build.ps1` and `Dockerfile.rust`.
* Drives RUST version, working directories, and logging paths.

### 🔸 `Dockerfile.rust` (✅ Clean)

* Multi-stage build using Rust 1.87.0-slim.
* Correctly switches to non-root `appuser`.
* Ensures logs directory exists and is writable before switch.

### 🔸 `build.ps1` (✅ Effective)

* Manually parses `.env` and sets env vars for Docker.
* Handles Compose temp file cleanup and override safety (`.docker_temp`).
* Resolves permission issues previously blocking container access to `/logs`.

---

## 📦 **System Features (Fully Built)**

### 📘 Log Entry Foundation

* `BaseLogEntry` supports all standard fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `source`, `category`.
* Serialization via `serde` is wired.
* Extension types (e.g., `CovenantLogEntry`) have stub structs but no active use yet.

### 📊 Severity Scale System

* Five base scales implemented.
* Human-readable labels included for enums (e.g., `Perfect`, `Critical`, `Fatal`).
* Mapped degradation is cleanly separated by logic branch.

### ⚙️ Alignment Score Mapping

* Actively used in `alignment.rs` with deterministic conversion of numeric scores to enums.
* Default logic routes through **Base10**.
* Future hooks for alternate scaling confirmed, but not activated.

### 🔗 Log Type Mapping

* `LogType` enum is **fully mapped**.
* Default severities are included.
* Scoring profiles exist, though many advanced thresholds are placeholders.

---

## 🔁 Lifecycle State

* Watchtower initializes from `main.rs` via `lib::watchtower::init_watchtower()` call.
* Runtime launches without error under Docker.
* File-based log output is **not yet implemented** — only in-memory routing exists.
* No log routing system (`log_router.rs`) actively dispatches logs to file or streams yet.

| ------------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Log File Writing         | ❌ Not Done    | `log_writer.rs` exists but unused         |
| LogRouter Dispatch Logic | ❌ Not Active  | `log_router.rs` exists, logic incomplete  |
| Specialized Entries      | ⚠️ Stubs Only | No actual extension of `BaseLogEntry` yet |
| Config-based Routing     | ❌ Missing     | `log_config.toml` not present             |
