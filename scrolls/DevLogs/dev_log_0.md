> *"Commit your work to Yahweh, and your plans will be established." — Proverbs 16:3*

This entry is both technical and spiritual—capturing what was laid down, and the posture in which it was begun.

Before proceeding, briefly reflect:

* 🔹 **Alignment Check** — Is this groundwork rooted in clarity, intent, and stewardship?
* 🔹 **Integrity Check** — Are initial goals and context documented with transparency?
* 🔹 **Stewardship Check** — Have we set up the foundation faithfully?

### Overview

**Summary of today's accomplishments:**
Phase 0 focused on preparing the foundation for the **CLI Gate** and **GUI Gate** in OmniCore. Today's work established the **root folder structure** and clarified what the Gate system will become. No code was implemented yet; today’s progress was all about direction, vision, and preparing for the next development stages.

* **Phase/Focus:** Creating the Gate (CLI and GUI)
* **Significant Progress:** Root structure established; clear intention and technical direction set for future phases.
* **Challenges/Breakthroughs:** No technical obstacles today; focus was on vision-setting and scaffolding.
