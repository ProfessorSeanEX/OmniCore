## 📖 About This Log

This log documents technical developments, accomplishments, and challenges faced during `[Current Development Phase]`. It provides clear insights into daily progress, decisions, and the technical integrity required to uphold the OmniCore foundation.

More than a technical record, this log stands as a daily witness of stewardship and intentional alignment—honoring God through excellence in both posture and performance.

> 🛠️ *"Technical excellence honors the Creator, while covenant alignment ensures clarity and purpose."*

Each entry serves dual roles:

* **Technical Clarity**: Documenting precise tasks, features, and challenges clearly for ongoing development and accountability.
